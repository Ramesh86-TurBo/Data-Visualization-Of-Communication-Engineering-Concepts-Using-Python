1) EXP1: To simulate Amplitude Modulation(AM) & Demodulation using Python

Concept: Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a modulation technique used to transmit information by varying the amplitude of a high-frequency carrier signal in proportion to the instantaneous amplitude of a lower-frequency message signal. This variation in amplitude allows the encoded message signal to be carried within the carrier signal.

Demodulation is the process of extracting the original message signal from the modulated carrier signal. In AM demodulation, the modulated signal is passed through a demodulator circuit or algorithm that isolates the variations in amplitude and reconstructs the original message signal. This demodulated signal can then be further processed or analyzed as needed.
